## Needfinding
  ### Interview summaries
  
  #### Interview 1
  The student from the University of Zurich prefers lunch with a close-knit group, finding it a refreshing 
  break from studies. They frequent a nearby canteen due to convenience and communicate through 
  WhatsApp. Queueing time matters, but they're open to sharing their schedule online. Novelty and 
  canteen quality aren't major concerns. They're uncomfortable eating alone, highlighting social 
  pressure. Improved communication within friend groups is a need.
   
  #### Interview 2
  The intern values proximity, familiarity, and price for lunch. They appreciate a mix of familiar and new 
  faces. Novelty and venue changes are less crucial. They usually go at 11:30 without prior 
  communication, WhatsApp is used for rare plan adjustments. Eating alone provides downtime. They're 
  open to selective schedule sharing. They consider sharing availability with close coworkers first. Their 
  static work environment suggests less need for scheduling apps, but they could be beneficial in more 
  flexible situations.
  
  #### Interview 3 
  A Mathematics student at ETH who frequently switches between three different groups of friends 
  based on his class schedule. The organization of these meetups usually takes place through WhatsApp, 
  with the same three individuals typically proposing the plans. More often than not, they choose to
  dine at the university cafeteria. The interviewee tends to become nervous if the break exceeds one 
  hour. The group often goes for a walk during his lunch break.
  
  #### Interview 4
  Humanities student in London. The individual typically brings their own lunch, as cafeterias are not as 
  commonly used as they are in Zurich. This is particularly the case because students at that uni don't 
  usually spend their entire day on campus. The interviewee often has lunch with classmates who are in 
  the same course that takes place immediately before lunchtime. The timing of lunch can be quite 
  flexible.
   
  #### Interview 5

  it more important to have fast decisions and good planning. This person likes to go eat with the same 
  people, and prefers smaller groups. 
   
  #### Interview 6 
  This person works at Credit Suisse and studies IT at ZHAW on the side. This person prefers to with other 
  people, and likes big groups. This person does not mind if there are any other people joining, as long 
  as some of his good friends are there. For this person, it is important that they can find a place to eat 
  as fast as possible, and to be able to have nice long lunchbreaks. 
  
  #### Interview 7

  people. They have no struggles with making lunch plans and always eats lunch with different people 
  depending on the weekday.
   
  #### Interview 8
  They study communication in the Masters and like to eat with 1-3 people. The price of the lunch is a 
  big factor. They usually make plans very spontaneously with eating and do not mind eating alone 
  sometimes but prefer to eat with people. Whether they eat with new people or people they know 
  does not matter as much.
  
  ### Interview 9
  The psychology student at the University of Zurich values familiarity in their lunch companions and 
  appreciates the availability of vegan options. Their lunchtime usually spans from 11:30 to 12:30. The 
  number of people and change of venue aren't major concerns. They use WhatsApp to organize lunch 
  plans. They're open to sharing their schedule via an app. Their primary need is to have lunch with a 
  consistent group of familiar faces. The insight gathered suggests that many prioritize familiarity for 
  comfort amid the demands of university life.
   
  #### Interview 10
  The ETH Master's student prioritizes familiarity in lunch companions and values the social aspect of 
  meals. They have a wide lunchtime window between 11:00 and 14:00, lasting 1 to 2 hours. The location 
  and novelty of venues aren't significant factors for them. They're comfortable with sharing their 
  schedule through an app. Their preference is for a relaxed, fixed group. The insight gained highlights 
  the importance of social connections during meals, providing a break from daily routines.
  
  #### Interview 11
  A student at ETH Zurich needs an all-in-one app for canteen menus, the ability to input a fixed time 
  and place for lunch, and suggestions for changing lunch time or canteen. So far, it has been a discord 
  group with which coordination has been done. Normal time tends to be at 13:00 since there is a 
  massive queue at 12:00.

## "How Might We" Statements
- How might we enable users to find a common lunchtime in a time-efficient manner?
  - How might we enable the user to show their friends when they are available for lunch?
  - How might we reduce the amount of work needed to plan lunch and remove repetitive actions?
  - How might we make the user feel at ease with sharing lunch with a less familiar person?

  - How might we prompt users to keep their shared lunchtime slots updated?
  - How might we decide how to prioritize the different needs of the users? (Place, Time, Amount of people)
- How might we integrate in-app decision-making features for lunch plans?
- How might we enable the user to select a specific restaurant or provide his preferences?
